        Queue is a FIFO datastructure: First in First out

        so the first Item/Data/Node (I don't know) we put
        is the first we remove

        it's in contrast with the stack which is LIFO:
        Last in First out

        //Pseudocode

        /*
        think of it like standing in Queue to the Friday bar
        the first there, the first to get a Beer.


        if we say everybody in our class has gotten a beer
        and there is no one else then we can say

        the Queue Size = 0

        and all of a sudden a student from some other class
        comes in then he is

        Enqueue or has been Pushed to the bar

        so the student represents the front/head of the Queue and
        the back/tail of the Queue because he/she is the only one there

        now the Queue is Size = 1

        and then another student comes now he's the Back/tail of the Queue
        and the Queue Size = 2

        and another student comes now he's the Back/tail of the Queue
        and the queue size = 3

        but wait the number 2 student isn't the Back/tail of the Queue
        anymore

        //DeQueuing
        /*
        Dequeuing only happens in the front, remember FIFO:
        First in First Out

        now let's continue with the example:

        the first student has gotten his beer now he/she's gone or
        Dequeued

        now student number 2 is the Front/head of the Queue

        ect.
