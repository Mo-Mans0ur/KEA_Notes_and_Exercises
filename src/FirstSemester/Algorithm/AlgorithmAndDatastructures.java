        what is an FirstSemester.Algorithm?

        an algorithm is a series of instructions telling the pc
        how to solve one or many specific problems or solve an
        equation

        for people its useful info, for machines its instructions or
        more input for more algorithm.

        math is a form of algorithm we have a certain way of "solving"
        equations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        an example for everyday use algorithm is a step-by-step
        recipe in a recipe there's detailed information to reach something
        the same way as an algorithm

        a recipe is dependent on (input) ingredients to make a cake (output)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        to sum up: an algorithm is a very detailed way of solving a problem


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        what kind of FirstSemester.Algorithm is there?
        the short answer is there's a lot of algorithms in the world but let
        take one to focus on like

        googles pagerank algorithm: it helps a user with the help of keywords
        that has been set by the user and gives the most relevant answer that
        matches those keywords.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        we are going to be focusing on linear search and sorting (in class)

        //Datastructure
  /*
        what is Datastructures?

        It's as the name, datastructures is a predefined method to organise data
        in a pc, so the elements in the datastructure can be pulled and used
        as pleased.

        think of data element as an ice cube then the datastructure is the ice
        cube tray/mold (whatever it's called)

        we have actually been introduced to datastructure before: Arrays to be
        exact. and array is a collection of data with the same type with a limited
        number of elements
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        what kind of datastructures is there?

        like algorithms there's a bunch of datastructures the thing we are going to
        focus on is an ArrayList, an arraylist is a bit complex type that changes
        size after how many elements there's put, but it's based on an array.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        other than that we are going to focus on what is called a Stack and a cue
        (in class)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        why is algorithm and datastructures relevant to programming
        and software development?

        algorithm and datastructure is a big topic, and it has more relation to
        math than programming and software development

        there's so much relation to a development with great working algorithm
        and a well-made software like the example with googles pagerank algorithm

        we also have encryption algorithm: hide some code so the wrong hands don't get to it

        compression algorithm: from big files to small files so its bun width gets easier to
        send from A to B.

        or a road display algorithm: Google Maps (literally)
