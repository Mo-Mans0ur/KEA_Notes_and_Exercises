        methods can be useful to make... yeah a method that's when
        you ask if this user is logged in it can give
        the answer "yes this user is logged in" or "no, there's no
        user logged in"

        2. example for a method is you can put a for example a
        facebook post, and you ask it "can you find the comments
        under the post for me"

        or you can make a new user like "hey method I wish to
        make a new user I have this name, age, where I live, my dead
        aunts name ect." and it will fill out the rest

        OR you can get some new structure in your code.

        "public static" is a what you call a modifier of a method
        but don't worry we are not talking about that yet, It's when
        we talk about classes. just ignore it for now.

        "String" after "public static" is java want to return in our
        method, that is the TYPE we will return and in this case
        it's our "String type"

        "emojifyAString" is the name of the method WE gave it

        and (String stringToEmojify) is our parameter in our
        parameter we have the type "String" and we called it
        "stringToEmojify"

        so our input in this method is a normal and boring string
        to a string with an emoji

        ...what you call the parameters too is "a place holder value"
